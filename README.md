Programming assignment from Andrew Ng's Coursera Deep Learning course. I made the get_images function by myself and downloaded a cats/dogs image dataset
from https://www.kaggle.com/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset, and got the guide for doing this homework from https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera.
